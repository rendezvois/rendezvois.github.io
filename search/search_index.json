It is primarily found in rips from DVD, VHS and TV. Some lower quality Blu-ray content, especially Extras, are also anamorphically encoded. What are anamorphic files? # Anamorphic files are encoded (or stored) at a different resolution than what they are displayed at. The resolution at which such a file is stored is called the Storage Resolution , and the resolution at which it is actually displayed for the end user is called the Display Resolution . For example, a file may be encoded at 720x480 resolution, but at the time of playback, it's scaled to 853x480 by your media player or device. For our purposes, the screenshots need to be taken at the Display Resolution. Screenshots taken at Storage Resolution will appear to be bad aspect ratio. They will look shrunk or stretched, and will not represent what the video actually looks like to someone watching the film. Example of screenshot taken at storage vs display resolution: (After clicking once on either tab, you can also press the Left or Right arrow keys to navigate.) Storage Resolution Display Resolution How to tell if a file is anamorphic? # MediaInfo summary on site: # The easiest way is to look at the mediainfo summary on site. Whenever the Resolution field shows two values, one after the other, the file is anamorphic. The resolutions are displayed in the form Storage RES ~> Display RES . The screenshots must be taken in the second resolution, i.e. Display Resolution. However, for many files, the screenshots will not match the Display Resolution exactly. There can be a discrepancy of 10 or 20 pixels between the screenshots and the Display Resolution shown in the summary. This is normal, and it happens because the Display aspect ratio in mediainfo is an approximation instead of being an exact value. For example, mediainfo may round an AR of 1.834:1 to 1.85:1. Advanced MediaInfo: # The second way is through the Advanced mode in mediainfo. There are two ways to take Advanced mediainfo of a file. CLI : mediainfo -f file.mkv > output.txt GUI : Load the file in the mediainfo application. First, go to View in menu bar and ensure that the Text view is selected. Then click on Debug and then Advanced mode . See this screenshot if you need help finding it. For illustration purposes, a sample file of resolution 718x436 was chosen. The relevant part we want from the Advanced mediainfo, under Video section, is: Pixel aspect ratio : 1.422 Display aspect ratio : 2.342 Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1 If the Pixel aspect ratio is NOT exactly 1.000, the file is anamorphic. How to find out the precise Display Resolution? # 1.1 Using PAR : # The PAR can be used to find out what the Display Resolution should be. Just multiply the width of the file with the PAR value. So since the file's storage resolution is 718x436, the display width will be \\(718 \\times 1.422\\) which equals \\(1021\\) . Therefore, your screenshots will come out to approximately 1021x436. 1.2 Using PAR (alternate method): # Some media players might display this file at an alternate display resolution, where instead of the width being multiplied, the height gets divided by the PAR . In the above example, the calculation becomes \\(436 \\div 1.422 = {\\sim}307\\) . Therefore, the alternate display resolution of this file will be 718x307. Once again, this gives a similar Display aspect ratio: \\(718 \\div 307 = 2.339\\) . You can think of this alternate resolution as the video being downscaled instead of upscaled when rescaling the video from the storage resolution to the display resolution. Another way of visualizing this is : To rescale such a file, you can either stretch it horizontally or shrink it vertically. Stretching it horizontally is the usual way, while shrinking it vertically is the alternate way. 1.3 Using DAR : # Instead of using PAR , take the precise Display aspect ratio from the Advanced mediainfo and multiply the height with it. This is in contrast to using the PAR , where we multiplied the width instead of the height. So, for the above example of a 718x436 file, the resulting width becomes \\(436 \\times 2.342 = 1021\\) , which is the same width we got using the PAR method. However, I do not prefer this method, simply because it is easier to spot an anamorphic file using the Pixel aspect ratio \u2014 if PAR is NOT 1.000, it is anamorphic. graph TD; A[\"<b>Encode at storage resolution</b> <br /> <i>Dimensions:</i> 718x436 <br /> <i>PAR:</i> 1.422 <br /> <i>DAR:</i> 2.342 <br /> <i>SAR:</i> 1.647\"]; A -->|\"Method 1.1 (Using PAR)\"| B[\"<b>Multiply the width with the PAR.</b> <br /> <u>Calculation:</u> 718 \u00d7 1.422 = 1021 <br /> <u>Result:</u> 1021x436 <br /> <u>AR:</u> 2.3417\"]; A -->|\"Method 1.2 (Using PAR - Alt.)\"| C[\"<b>Divide the height with the PAR.</b> <br /> <u>Calculation:</u> 436 \u00f7 1.422 = 307 <br /> <u>Result:</u> 718x307 <br /> <u>AR:</u> 2.3387\"]; A -->|\"Method 1.3 (Using DAR)\"| D[\"<b>Multiply the height with the DAR.</b> <br /> <u>Calculation:</u> 436 \u00d7 2.342 = 1021 <br /> <u>Result:</u> 1021x436 <br /> <u>AR:</u> 2.342\"]; Correlation between SAR , DAR and PAR : This part is not directly relevant to taking screenshots, but it is being mentioned for the curious. Pay attention to the correlation between the display resolution of 1021x436 we got above and the first Display aspect ratio ( DAR ) in the Advanced mediainfo above: \\(1021 \\div 436 = {\\sim}2.342\\) , which matches the first Display aspect ratio in the Advanced mediainfo. That first value is more precise, while the second one is a rounded value. The precise value is only shown in the Advanced mediainfo. A commonly known equation is \\(DAR = SAR \\times PAR\\) . The acronyms DAR and PAR have already been referenced above. SAR refers to the Storage aspect ratio . Simply put, it is the ratio of the (storage) width to the (storage) height. For the sample file we chose above, its SAR is \\(718 \\div 436 = {\\sim}1.647\\) . Its PAR is already known to be 1.422. Therefore, its DAR = \\(1.647 \\times 1.422\\) which equals \\(2.342\\) , which in turn, matches the value in the Advanced mediainfo. 1.4 Using mkvinfo, or the \"Info Tool\" in MKVToolnix GUI : # MKVToolnix comes with both a CLI and a GUI tool to display information of an MKV file.

VLC Media Player # Official Webpage Version 2.1.5 Info The latest version of VLC works correctly for most types of files. But some DVDs authored with improper aspect ratio play properly only in VLC 2.1.5. See the section at the end for more details. Versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.4 take screenshots at Storage Resolution for all files, so they cannot be used for anamorphic files. Setting up VLC: # Press Ctrl + P or go to the Menu bar, then Tools > Preferences > Video tab. Under the Format dropdown, ensure that png is selected. On the same Video tab, it is also recommended to set Deinterlacing to Off. Make a note of the folder the Directory option is set at, or change it if you wish. This is where VLC will save the screenshots. Taking the screenshots: # Open the video by either pressing Ctrl + O , or by going to the Menu bar > Media > Open File , or by simply dragging and dropping the file inside the player window. VLC also works well for streaming a file from your seedbox/server with http(s). To load a remote file, press Ctrl + N or click on the Menu bar > Media > Open Network Stream . You can also just copy the URL of the file in your browser, then switch to the VLC window, and press Ctrl + V . Ensure that any soft subtitles are turned off by going to the Menu bar > Subtitle > Sub Track > Disable . This step must not be skipped. Find a suitable spot in the video of which you want to take a screenshot. To take the screenshot, press Shift + S or go to the Menu bar > Video > Take Snapshot . The screenshot should now be saved in the directory set in the Preferences. Visual Animated Guide: Click here Bug where using version 2.1.5 is needed: Some rare/old DVDs are improperly authored where the video plays in Storage Resolution (instead of Display Resolution) on most players, including latest VLC. Thus, the video playback and/or the screenshots are in bad aspect ratio. Many such DVDs will have a discrepancy in the Display aspect ratio between the main IFO file and the corresponding VOB files. See this screenshot for an example. Properly authored DVDs should have the same value for Aspect ratio in both the IFO and the VOB. VLC 2.1.5 is usually able to play such DVDs properly. You do not need to install this old version on your system. You can just download the portable version from the Version 2.1.5 link given at the top. Download the 7z or zip file instead of the exe. Important: You must load the DVD in VLC 2.1.5 as a disc for it to work properly. Opening the VOB file directly will once again give you bad aspect ratio screenshots. To load the folder as a disc, press Ctrl + D or go to the Menu bar > Media > Open Disc . See this screenshot for help. MPC-HC # Official Webpage Info Do NOT download from mpc-hc.org . That is an old build which is no longer updated. Setting up MPC-HC: # Two main video renderer options: Enhanced Video Renderer (custom presenter) and madVR . EVR (custom presenter) is what MPC-HC comes with by default, while madVR can be optionally installed for better quality. To change the setting for the video renderer, press O or go to the Menu bar > View > Options . Then click on Output in the sidebar. The renderer options will be in a dropdown under DirectShow Video . See this screenshot for help. You need to restart MPC-HC if you switch the renderer. EVR (custom presenter) does not need any special setup. For madVR: Open any video and pause it, then right click on the video, select Filters > madVR . Then click on Edit Settings . In the madVR settings window, go to rendering > screenshots , select the checkbox for create screenshots with a custom zoom factor , and then select the encoded video size option.

Visual Animated Guide: Click here Bug where using version 2.1.5 is needed: Some rare/old DVDs are improperly authored where the video plays in Storage Resolution (instead of Display Resolution) on most players, including latest VLC. Thus, the video playback and/or the screenshots are in bad aspect ratio. Many such DVDs will have a discrepancy in the Display aspect ratio between the main IFO file and the corresponding VOB files. See this screenshot for an example. Properly authored DVDs should have the same value for Aspect ratio in both the IFO and the VOB. VLC 2.1.5 is usually able to play such DVDs properly. You do not need to install this old version on your system. You can just download the portable version from the Version 2.1.5 link given at the top. Download the 7z or zip file instead of the exe. Important: You must load the DVD in VLC 2.1.5 as a disc for it to work properly. Opening the VOB file directly will once again give you bad aspect ratio screenshots. To load the folder as a disc, press Ctrl + D or go to the Menu bar > Media > Open Disc . See this screenshot for help.","title":"Taking the screenshots:"},{"location":"video/screenshots/programs-choices/#mpc-hc","text":"Official Webpage Info Do NOT download from mpc-hc.org .
